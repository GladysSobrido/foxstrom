  "strom3": "FoxStrom sold electricity from the Austrian hydropower plant AltenwÃ¶rth in 2020. The power plant is operated by Verbund AG and was commissioned in 1975. Since 2021, FoxStrom has included wind power in its electricity mix and has been receiving direct supplies from the state-of-the-art Midtfjellet wind farm, which was only built in the last 10 years.",

  "solar3": "A solar system with storage and smart energy services allows you to use green electricity from your own PV system even when the sun isn't shining. Early in the morning, in the evening and at night, you can supply your electrical appliances, an electric heater or the WallBox for your electric car with self-generated solar power. This can reduce your electricity costs by up to 89%. What's more, you not only save money, but also protect the climate: with the help of a photovoltaic system with storage, you can generate, use and store your electricity directly on site - there is no need to transport decentrally generated electricity over long distances.",
  "solar4": "How much does a solar system with storage cost?",
  "solar5": "How much you pay for your photovoltaic system with storage depends, among other things, on the size of the system. This in turn depends on your usable roof area and your electricity requirements. On average, most single-family homes have a usable roof area of up to 60 mÂ². A photovoltaic system that produces between 4 and 10 kWp is usually installed on this area. The cost of such a solar system with an electricity storage unit is around â‚¬11,500 to â‚¬30,300. When your photovoltaic system will pay for itself depends on various factors. For a typical system with 8 kWp including electricity storage, for example, you should expect around 16 years. From then on, you will be producing solar power virtually free of charge.",

  "lade1": "Charging stations for electric cars",
  "lade2": "Household electricity consumption can skyrocket. To prevent the same thing happening to costs, the Ã–koStrom E-Auto tariff is ideal for anyone who wants to charge their electric car at home. You also charge in a climate-neutral way with 100% green electricity.",
  "lade3": "Really, electric car and rental apartment? That fits too! The tariff is not just for owner-occupied homes. And if you do want to charge on the go: with E-Auto Unterwegs, you can not only quickly find the nearest public charging station, you can also charge at the lowest fixed price. Or at over 440,000 public charging points across Europe.",
